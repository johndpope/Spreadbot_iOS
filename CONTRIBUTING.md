# Contributing

The Spreadbot iOS client is maintained and updated by Spreadbot community members. We'd love to have you join our efforts! Here are a few ways you can help:

* _Fixing problems_: If you find a problem on the iOS client, the most helpful thing you can do is open a pull request. If you're not sure how to fix it, open an issue.
* _Contributing solicited content_: We try to make it easy for people to contribute to the iOS client by tagging issues with _help wanted_ when appropriate. The best way to get started contributing content is to pick up one of these issues.
* _Contributing unsolicited content_: If you'd like to contribute content that you think is missing, please start by checking the issues page. There may already be a plan to add this content! If not, open an issue yourself so that you can get feedback before you start writing. 
* _Writing infrastructure code_: You can also help out with the iOS client by improving the Spreadbot codebase. Issues related to writing infrastructure code have the label _infrastructure_.
